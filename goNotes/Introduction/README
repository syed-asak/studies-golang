ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The Go programming language, commonly referred to as Golang, was created by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and
Ken Thompson at Google.

It is an open-source, general-purpose programming language designed for high-performance networking and 
multiprocessing.

Originally, the Go compiler was implemented in C, but it is now self-hostedâ€”written in Go itself.

This repository aims to share some basic concepts of Go to help you understand and kickstart your 
Go programming journey.
