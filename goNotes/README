WHY GO PROGRAMMING?

Most programming languages support multithreading, which allows programs to perform multiple tasks concurrently. However, building reliable multithreaded applications can be challenging due to issues like:

    Race conditions – when multiple threads access shared data without proper synchronization.

    Deadlocks – when threads get stuck waiting on each other’s resources.

Java Threading Limitation

For example, in Java, creating a new thread consumes approximately 1 MB of heap memory. So, creating thousands of threads can quickly exhaust the system memory, potentially leading to an OutOfMemoryError.
Go's Solution: Goroutines

Go (Golang) addresses this problem with goroutines:

    A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime.

    Each goroutine starts with just ~2 KB of memory (instead of 1 MB like Java threads).

    They grow in memory usage as needed, which makes them highly scalable.

    You can run millions of goroutines concurrently without running out of memory.

    Goroutines are not tied 1:1 to OS threads – they are scheduled onto available threads by the Go runtime, which improves efficiency and startup time.
